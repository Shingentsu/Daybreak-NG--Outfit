# Using the mod

Download the NG+_Outfit_Mod.p3a file.

After that, navigate to the folder where you have installed Trails through Daybreak. In that location, create a new folder named a 'mods' if you haven't done it before. Just drop the NG+_Outfit_Mod.p3a file in it and you're done.

Boot up the game and you should be able to buy these outfits in the Montmart shop that Paulette usually has.

# Using the mod with other mods

In the case you are using different mods and are not sure if there could be some conflict with this mod, you can make use fo eArmada's [Kuro DLC tool](https://github.com/eArmada8/kuro_dlc_tool/releases) to fuse them together. In that case, you'll need the kurodlc.json file instead of the .p3a file.

In case you have more questions regarding the tool, you can join the [Kiseki Modding Server](https://discord.gg/wYkWS33NQt) and ask about it there.

# Why Paulette's shop specifically?

Short Answer: It's a meta joke

Long Answer: In the 5th chapter of the Agnes's style spin off manga, Yumé gets Agnès to try on various outfits that belong to Paulette, and the Golden Blood Suit is one of them. So, I decided to place the costumes there as a meta joke of Paulette somehow getting them for you.
